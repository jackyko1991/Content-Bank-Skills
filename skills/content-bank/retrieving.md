# Retrieving Content

Retrieve previously banked content—writing or code—to use in current work.

## Workflow

1. **Ask** the user what they need (topic, type, keywords)
2. **Search** the content bank for matching entries
3. **Present** results as a structured list with previews
4. **Let the user** integrate content into their work (do not auto-insert)

## Search Capabilities

- Search by topic name
- Search by content type (ideas, snippets, outlines)
- Search by type (writing, code)
- Search by language (for code)
- Search by tags/keywords
- Full-text search across entries

## Usage

```
Find content about {topic}
What do I have banked on {keywords}?
Retrieve [ideas/snippets/outlines] about {topic}
What code do I have for {problem}?
Find {language} snippets about {topic}
```
